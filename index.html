   

This guide is meant to help Git and GitHub beginners get up and running with GitHub Pages and Jekyll in an afternoon. It assumes you know very little about version control, Git, and GitHub. It is helpful if you know the basics of HTML and CSS since we'll be working directly with these languages. We'll also be using a little bit of Markdown, but by no means do you need to be an expert with any of these languages. The idea is to learn by doing, so the code we'll be implementing in this tutorial is available in this guide or can be downloaded entirely at this GitHub repo. Feel free to copy and paste or type this code directly into your project's files.

For a little background on why I chose GitHub and GitHub Pages for my personal website (and other projects), see this note.
Other Resources You Should Know

In order to make GitHub Pages accessible to a wider audience, this guide focuses on using the web interface on github.com to build your personal website, thereby generalizing and glossing over the standard tools associated with Git and GitHub. To get a lot dirtier wit Git and GitHub (ie, the command line and terminal), there are several other great guides you should also know about, probably bookmark, and read after completing this one, or jump over to if that is more your speed: Anna Debenham, Thinkful, and even GitHub itself go above and beyond making the command line or local workflow of GitHub hosting and Jekyll templates accessible to a wider audience.

Also, at the end of this document, there is a pretty good list of resources related to Git, GitHub/Pages, Jekyll, and Markdown that can help you dive deeper into these tools. I'll do my best to keep this list updated as I find new ones.
What is Git, GitHub, and GitHub Pages?

Git, GitHub, and GitHub Pages are all very closely related. Imagine Git as the workflow to get things done and GitHub and GitHub Pages as places to store the work you finish. Projects that use Git are stored publicly in GitHub and GitHub Pages, so in a very generalized way, Git is what you do locally on your own computer and GitHub is the place where all this gets stored publicly on a server.
Git

Git is a version control system that tracks changes to files in a project over time. It typically records what the changes were (what was added? what was removed from the file?), who made the changes, notes and comments about the changes by the changer, and at what time the changes were made. It is primarily used for software development projects which are often collaborative, so in this sense, it is a tool to help enable and improve collaboration. However, its collaborative nature has led it to gain interest in the publishing community as a tool to help in both authoring and editorial workflows.

Git is for people who want to maintain multiple versions of their files in an efficient manner and travel back in time to visit different versions without juggling numerous files along with their confusing names stored at different locations. Think of Git and version control like a magic undo button.

In the diagram below, each stage represents a “save”. Without Git, you cannot go back to any of the in between stages from the initial draft and final draft. If you wanted to change the opening paragraph in the final draft, you’d have to delete data that you couldn’t recover. To work around this, we use the “save as” option, name it something different, delete the opening paragraph and start writing a new one.

With Git, the flow is multidirectional. Each change that is significant is marked as important in a version, and you proceed. If you you need to get back to earlier stages, you can without any loss of data. Presently, Google Docs “revision history” or Wikipedia’s “edit history” work in this sort of fashion. Git is just a lot more detailed and can get a lot more complex if needed.1

When you have the chance, I highly recommend this 15 minute, hands-on web tutorial on using Git.
GitHub

GitHub is a web hosting service for the source code of software and web development projects (or other text based projects) that use Git. In many cases, most of the code is publicly available, enabling developers to easily investigate, collaborate, download, use, improve, and remix that code. The container for the code of a specific project is called a repository.

There are thousands of really cool and exciting repositories on GitHub, with new ones added every day. Some examples of popular software development projects that make their code available on GitHub include:

    Twitter Bootstrap, an extremely popular front-end framework for mobile first websites, created by developers at Twitter.
    HTML5 Boilerplate, a front-end template for quickly building websites,
    The JavaScript Visualization Library D3
    Ruby on Rails, the open-source web framework built on Ruby.

Usually, people just host the files that contain their code, so what you see on the end view is the actual code, as in this example from the Ruby on Rails project:
GitHub Pages

GitHub Pages are public webpages hosted for free through GitHub. GitHub users can create and host both personal websites (one allowed per user) and websites related to specific GitHub projects. Pages lets you do the same things as GitHub, but if the repository is named a certain way and files inside it are HTML or Markdown, you can view the file like any other website. GitHub Pages is the self-aware version of GitHub. Pages also comes with a powerful static site generator called Jekyll, which we'll learn more about later on.
Getting Started with GitHub Pages

Don't worry if some of these concepts are still a little fuzzy to you. The best way to learn this stuff is to just start doing the work, so let's not waste anymore time and dive right in.

1Create your project's repository. Login to your GitHub account and go to https://github.com/new or click the New repository icon from your account homepage.

2 Name your repository username.github.io, replacing username with your GitHub username. Be sure it is public and go ahead and tell GitHub to create a README file upon generating the repo.

3 Create an index.html page by clicking the plus icon next to your repository name and typing the file name directly in the input box that appears.

On the resulting page, put this markup inside of the GitHub text editor:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
	<head>
		<title>Hank Quinlan, Horrible Cop</title>
	</head>
	<body>
		<nav>
    		<ul>
        		<li><a href="/">Home</a></li>
	        	<li><a href="/about">About</a></li>
        		<li><a href="/cv">CV</a></li>
        		<li><a href="/blog">Blog</a></li>
    		</ul>
		</nav>
		<div class="container">
    		<div class="blurb">
        		<h1>Hi there, I'm Hank Quinlan!</h1>
				<p>I'm best known as the horrible cop from <em>A Touch of Evil</em> Don't trust me. <a href="/about">Read more about my life...</a></p>
    		</div><!-- /.blurb -->
		</div><!-- /.container -->
		<footer>
    		<ul>
        		<li><a href="mailto:hankquinlanhub@gmail.com">email</a></li>
        		<li><a href="https://github.com/hankquinlan">github.com/hankquinlan</a></li>
			</ul>
		</footer>
	</body>
</html>
